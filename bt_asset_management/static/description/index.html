        </div>
        <p class='oe_mt32 text-justify'>
A simple and independent App from BroadTech IT Solutions to manage the assets owned by an organization. 
It helps to capture, organize and analyse Asset related information without much complications. 
Movements of Assets between different locations are captured separately, which helps to track the entire history of an asset during its life cycle. 
Instead of removing an asset from the system and erasing its past, the deprecated assets are moved into a virtual location named "Scrap", so that the record and its history will be available in the system for ever. 
This app has no connection with Odoo accounting applications. </p>
